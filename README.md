## ❓ FAQ

❔ **Do I need coding experience to use this plugin?**  
Not at all! You just need access to your WordPress dashboard to manage the data, and you can use the Gutenberg editor to manage content.

❔ **Can I also import data?**
Yes! Since Football Club Manager is built using Custom Post Types, it's compatible with most import/export plugins. Even WordPress itself offers import/export features, which you can find in the **Tools** admin menu. Also, you can develop your own import plugin for automatic importing, like the one for [Sportlink](https://github.com/vincentbitter/fcm-for-sportlink).

? **Do you collect any data from me?**
No. Football Club Manager does not contain any tracking code or integration with external services. WordPress Plugin Directory tracks the number of installs though, but you can avoid even that by downloading a release from GitHub.

❔ **Is this plugin compatible with other WordPress themes or plugins?**
It’s designed to work with Gutenberg editor. While it should play nicely with most themes, custom styling may be needed depending on your setup.

? **What is Gutenberg editor?**
The standard page editor since WordPress 5.0 (December 2018). If you use a different editor, blocks might not work. Check the [demo](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) if you are not sure if your website uses it.
